# OCamlBC

OCaml...hell yeah


"If it compiles, it works" -Alin Dobrah

Features implemented: Math operations, boolean functions, variable storing, math functions, if statements, for loops, while loops, nested loops, functions, break and continue, recursive functions, local scoping. 

Features not implemented: dune testing :(

For testing we painstakingly handcrafted blocks of code to test different and ran them through runCode.

TO RUN OUR CODE:
    simply type "Ocaml bc.ml" and watch the magic unfurl.

We may be a day late, but we're ahead of everyone in terms of style ;).
